# Game of Life 
The *Game of Life* is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton **Conway** (1937-2020) in 1970.



## Rules
The *Game of Life* is a **two-dimensional grid of square cells**, each of which is in one of two possible states, *live or dead*, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours (adjacent cells). After each step in the game, the following *rules* apply: 

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, i.e. underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, i.e. overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, i.e. reproduction.
